# gh-oauth-app

https://otamachan.github.io/gh-oauth-app/

This is a sample web page application using GitHub OAuth.
A web page only application cannot use GitHub OAuth because its endpoint does not support CORS. https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/330 .
In this sample application, I use AWS Lambda/API Gateway to enable GitHub OAuth login with CORS support.
Please also refer to the [Cloudformation template](gh-aouth-app.template.yaml) for details.
